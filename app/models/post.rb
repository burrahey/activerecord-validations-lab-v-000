class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
   validates :title, presence: true, title: true
   validates :content, length: { minimum: 250 }
   validates :summary, length: { maximum: 250 }
   validates :category, inclusion: { in: %w(Fiction Non-Fiction fiction non-fiction) }

end

# All posts have a title
# Post content is at least 250 characters long
# Post summary is a maximum of 250 characters
# Post category is either Fiction or Non-Fiction This step requires an inclusion validator, which was not outlined in the README lesson. You'll need to refer to the Rails guide to look up how to use it.

# Finally, add a custom validator to Post that ensures the title is sufficiently
# clickbait-y. If the title does not contain "Won't Believe", "Secret", "Top [number]", or "Guess", the validator should return false.
# For future projects, it's a good idea to skim the list of available validation options.
# It will give you a sense of what's available and help with creating
# validations for your own model objects.
